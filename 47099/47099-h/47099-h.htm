<h2><a name="MAKING_PRETEND" id="MAKING_PRETEND">'MAKING PRETEND.'</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Little</span> girls play at 'Making Pretend,' often
assuming some such form as this: 'I'll be a lady,
and you shall be my servant.' We all of us
unconsciously imitate these little folks in many
of the daily proceedings of life, not from a really
dishonourable motive or wishing to wrong others.
'The truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the
truth' is a proper maxim for a witness in a court
of justice, and a wholesome precept to be taught
to all; but it is curious to watch among the highest
and purest in the land, as among the lowest and
most debased, how many are the obstacles to the
absolute observance of this precept.</p>

<p>Court-life is full of anomalies in this direction.
The 'Queen's Speech,' as we all know, is not the
Queen's Speech; it is not written by Her Majesty,
and for many years past has seldom been spoken
by her. The prime-minister writes it, after conferring
with his colleagues; the Lord Chancellor
reads it, as one of three commissioners named for
that special purpose. In earlier periods of our
history, when the sovereign was his own prime-minister,
and his officials were dismissed at his
will and pleasure, his speech was really a speech;
but now that the ministers are responsible for all
the public proceedings of the Crown, the speech
is a message, really theirs, although couched in
the first person singular, and read from a written
paper by other lips. Once now and then the
present Queen has had to be furnished with lighted
candles to enable her to read her own gracious
speech on the afternoon of a foggy day! The Queen
is loyally supposed to be present in every court of
justice, near the colours of every regiment, and on
the quarter-deck of every vessel belonging to the
royal navy. To salute the colours during a march-past
is to salute a symbol of sovereign power; and
even on the darkest night, or when no human
being sees him, a naval officer touches his cap
when stepping up to the quarter-deck. It is not
telling a little fib, but acting one; 'making pretend,'
for a purpose sanctioned by all and injurious to
none.</p>

<p>The 'honourable member for &mdash;&mdash;' may not be
distinguished for particularly honourable conduct
as a member of society; but it is felt that the
House of Commons must wink at this, and treat
him like the rest. The 'most reverend prelate,'
the 'reverend occupants of the spiritual bench,'
the 'illustrious duke on the cross benches,' the
'noble marquis,' the 'noble and learned lord,' the
'honourable and gallant member for &mdash;&mdash;,' 'my
right honourable friend'&mdash;all these are intended,
not as mere flatteries, but to preserve decorum and
courtesy in the proceedings of the two Houses.
If members mentioned one another by name, or
used the second person 'you,' unseemly wrangles
would almost inevitably occur; a little 'making
pretend,' even if involving a somewhat cumbrous
form of circumlocution, is found useful here; many
a foreign Chamber of Deputies or House of Representatives
suffers sadly from the absence of some
such rules.</p>

<p>'Your obedient servant;' this is a small fib; for
generally speaking, you are neither his servant
nor are you obedient to him. 'Truly yours' and
'Yours faithfully' are equally departures from
strict verity; in all probability your correspondent
has never done anything deserving of a gush of
warm sentiment on your part. 'Yours always
sincerely'&mdash;well, there may be a little earnestness
here; but 'always' is more than you can honestly
pledge yourself to. A fair lady is sometimes a
little embarrassed in this matter. She may be
under the necessity of writing to decline a tender
offer made to her by a gentleman. How is she to
address him? 'Yours respectfully,' or 'obediently,'
or 'truly'&mdash;why, this is what he wishes her to be,
but what she announces in the letter her refusal
to be; and 'your obedient servant' is no better;
for as she refuses to be his wife, she most certainly
will not be his servant. Turn the matter about
how we may, there is no apparent escape from
'making pretend,' unless the subscription to the
letter be limited to the mere signature. But
the 'making pretend' of respect or obedience is a
small courtesy which lessens the probability of
giving offence. And as with the subscription, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">{258}</a></span>
with the superscription; the word 'dear' is a fond
and affectionate one; but how often do we <i>really</i>
mean 'Dear sir' when we write those words?
While we write the little word we may feel ourselves
hypocrites for so doing, for reasons good
and sufficient; but we must keep up 'dear' for
form's sake. A young spendthrift heir writes to
'My dear father' for more supplies, and may yet
be willing to see 'dear father' in the grave for
the sake of the inheritance. The old man may
suspect this all the way along, but still he addresses
'My dear Tom.'</p>

<p>'Mr So-and-so is not at home.' Certainly not
true this, for you happened to catch a glimpse of
his features over the parlour window-blind. Apart
from any supposition that he owes you money
which he is not prepared to pay, he may really
have a good and sufficient reason for declining an
interview with you. But this degree of 'making
pretend' is a little too bad; 'Mr So-and-so declines
to see you' would be true, but rather discourteous;
and so perhaps a compromise is hit
upon, 'Mr So-and-so is engaged at present.'</p>

<p>'Come and take pot-luck with us to-morrow&mdash;all
in the rough, just as you find us;' not
quite true, for preparations are purposely made
for the reception of the visitor. 'Pray don't
think of going,' you politely say; although
as a fact it might be convenient to you and
your family that your guest should go at once.
'Always glad to see you'&mdash;most assuredly 'making
pretend,' for at best you only mean 'sometimes.'
When a young lady at a party declares that she
positively 'can't sing,' we take the assertion with
several grains of allowance. When healths are
drunk and thanks returned, we may do as we like
about believing 'the proudest moment of my life;'
and when, as sometimes happens at men's parties,
'He's a jolly good fellow' is sung after proposing
the toast, it may happen to be that the person thus
honoured is neither very jolly nor very good. All
the little incidents of social intercourse, if examined
critically, display somewhat similar indications of
the widely diffused 'making pretend.'</p>

<p>We thank people or praise people in various
ways, beyond our real meaning, from a sense of the
value of civilities. The Lord Chancellor always
assures the Recorder that Her Majesty very highly
approves of the selection which her faithful citizens
of London have made, when the Lord Mayor
elect is presented; and the civic functionary, on
that occasion, invites Her Majesty's judges to the
Guildhall banquet, although the invitation card
has been sent to each long before. 'I bow to your
ludship's superior judgment;' although it may be
known to both of them, and to the bench and the bar
generally, that the counsel really possesses greater
knowledge and ability than the judge. 'Gentlemen
of the jury' are much flattered by counsel;
penetration and sagacity are imputed to them in
large measure; the advocate does not mean what
he says, but he hopes to wheedle a verdict out of
them, in duty to the client who employs and pays
him. The judge, unspotted in his impartiality (an
inestimable advantage which we enjoy in this
country), has no temptation to indulge in such
flatteries, and is free from embarrassment in the
matter. As to a counsel positively stating his
belief in the innocence of the prisoner he is defending,
when he knows that the man is guilty, this
is a stretch of audacity on which much has been
written and said, and which leaves a painful impression
on conscientious minds; a skilful counsel
generally manages to avoid it, while using as much
whitewash as he can for the accused, and applying
plentiful blackwash to the witnesses for the prosecution.
The 'enlightened and independent electors'
of a borough do not believe that the candidate
is altogether sincere in thus addressing
them, while he himself has probably the means
of knowing that they are neither enlightened
nor independent; but the compliment is pleasing
to their vanity, and perchance they give him a
few extra cheers (or votes) as his reward.</p>

<p>'Making pretend,' in wholesale and retail trade,
is now carried to such an extent as to be a serious
evil. Where woollen goods are sold as 'all
wool,' despite the shoddy and cotton which enter
into their composition; where calico is laden with
chalk in order to augment its weight; where professed
flax and silk goods have a large percentage
of cotton, and alpaca goods are made of wool which
was never on the back of an alpaca&mdash;we are
justified in doubting whether the fib comes within
the range of allowable 'making pretend;' the
articles may possibly be worth the price charged,
but nevertheless they are put forth under false
names. The law-courts tell us that there are some
millers, 'rogues in grain,' who do not scruple to
mix up with their corn a cheap substance known
among them by the mysterious name of 'Jonathan.'
Butter is sold of which seventy per cent is <i>not</i>
butter. Tea, coffee, cocoa, and chicory are rendered
cheap by adulterants. London beer and
London gin (we will leave provincial towns to
speak for themselves) are often terribly sophisticated,
to give apparent strength by the addition
of drugs little less than poisonous. The frauds of
trade find their way into a greater and greater
number of departments and branches. 'Cream of
the valley gin,' the 'dew off Ben Nevis,' 'fine
crusted port,' 'pure dinner sherry'&mdash;we might
excuse a bit of exaggeration in the names, provided
the liquids themselves were genuine. 'Solid gold
chains,' made of an alloy containing only six ounces
of real gold to eighteen of baser metal, are now
displayed in glittering array in shop-windows;
and many 'real gold' articles have only a thin
film of gold to cover a substratum of cheap metal.
Soon after the Abyssinian war, when some of King
Theodore's golden trinkets were exhibited in
England, Birmingham or London or both produced
'Abyssinian gold' chains, watches, and
jewellery in which real gold was conspicuous by
its absence. Following this precedent, the same or
other makers introduced 'Ashanti' gold jewellery
after the little war in which Sir Garnet Wolseley
was engaged; and the auriferous quality of the one
was about equal to that of the other.</p>

<p>But apart from actual roguery, other modes
of attracting customers are noticeable for a kind
of whimsical audacity. A hairdresser, who sells
bear's grease, buys or rents a small bear, which
he placards profusely, and writes up, 'Here, and
at Archangel.' A furniture-dealer advertises, for
twelve or eighteen months together, that he is
enlarging his premises, and will sell off his stock
at low prices, to prevent the articles from being
injured by dust and dirt&mdash;his stock being quietly
renewed from time to time, and the prices remaining
pretty nearly the same as before. A draper
covers half the front of his house with inscriptions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">{259}</a></span>
relating to an alleged shipwreck or conflagration,
to denote how very cheaply he can sell the salvage.
'Dreadful depression in trade,' 'bankrupt stock,'
'ruinous sacrifice,' are well-known man&#339;uvres.
We hear of 'Hampshire rabbits' that never saw
Hampshire, and 'Newcastle salmon' that were
certainly neither caught nor pickled at Newcastle;
'Cheshire cheese' made in other shires; 'Melton-Mowbray
pies,' 'Bath buns,' and 'Banbury cakes'
made in London&mdash;these we can understand as
extensions in the production of certain articles
at one time localised.</p>

<p>The artistic or fine-art world is much troubled
with 'making pretend,' often involving white-lies
of considerable magnitude. 'Old Roman coins'
produced in an out-of-the-way workshop in London
or Birmingham; 'Fine old china' fabricated
within a recent period; a 'Genuine Rubens' that
originated somewhere near Wardour Street; a
'Landscape after Claude' (very much after)&mdash;are
sorrowfully known to purchasers endowed with
more money than brains. At one of the Great
Exhibitions, a French firm displayed two pearl
necklaces, of which one was valued (if we remember
rightly) at fifty-fold as much as the other, and yet
none but a practised observer could discriminate
between them. The exhibitor wished to shew,
and did shew, how skilfully he could make mock-pearls
imitate real&mdash;but what a temptation to
'making pretend!'</p></div>

<p class='p3'>CHAPTER XX.&mdash;MRS TIPPER AT HOME.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next morning I took care to find employment
for Lilian which would require the use of her
mind as well as her hands. Indeed we were
all as busy as bees, there being a great deal still
to be done in the way of putting our little home
in order. Fortunately, as it happened for us,
the builder had been obliged to make the rooms
larger and less formal in shape than are the
generality of cottage parlours, in order to carry out
the architect's design for the exterior of the building,
so we had two good sitting-rooms. Our
<i>drawing-room</i> gave ample opportunity for the display
of taste; and Mrs Tipper had begged me to
select the furniture, choose the paper for the walls,
and so forth. I did my best, in the way of
endeavouring to make an effective background for
the by no means few works of art which had arrived
from Fairview, and were now to be unpacked and
arranged by Lilian and me. Mrs Tipper had been
a little disappointed at my selecting sober tints
such as French gray for the walls, &amp;c.; confessing
that for her part she liked plenty of colour. Indeed
the dear little woman too fondly remembered the
best parlour in the little cottage at Holloway,
where she informed me gay plumaged birds
wandered up and down the walls amidst roses and
tulips, to take kindly to more sober tints. And
it required some diplomacy gracefully to decline
two heavy lumps of china, supposed to represent
Windsor Castle, which had been carefully preserved
as relics of old times, and which were now brought
forth from their beds of wool and presented as Mrs
Tipper's contribution in the way of fine art for the
drawing-room mantel-piece, with the information
that they had been purchased at Greenwich fair
and brought home as a surprise by 'John.' But
I contrived to make it apparent that we already
had as many ornaments as we knew what to do
with; and the happy thought occurred to me to
suggest that perhaps she would like to have the
gifts which had been presented by her husband on
the mantel-piece in her own room. At which she
was fain to confess that such had been her desire.
'Only I thought you wanted a little more colour
in the drawing-room, you know, dears; and I
should be sorry to be selfish.'</p>

<p>But as our work progressed she acknowledged
that the effect was 'elegant;' though I knew that
term did not mean the highest eulogy in her
estimation. The dainty collection of Sèvres and
Dresden, which had belonged to Lilian's mother,
the pictures, few valuable books, and the roses and
lilies of the chintz, imparted quite colour enough
to the room to satisfy us two. But it gave us
enough to do to arrange it all. To the portrait
of Lilian's mother, a really valuable painting,
the costly work of a celebrated Academician
(another extravagance of Mr Farrar's, deplored by
Marian), was of course assigned the place of honour.
She must have been a very lovely woman, of the
delicate refined type of beauty, which expresses so
much to certain minds, and the artist had evidently
worked <i>con amore</i>. He had seen the soul beneath,
and depicted what he had seen. I could well
understand the thought which had suggested the
simple white flowing dress and loosened hair, with
no ornament save a star above the broad white
brow, and which had caused him so to pose the
figure as to impart the idea that it was floating
upwards.</p>

<p>I have heard that Mr Farrar was not a little disappointed
in the picture, considering the style too
severe, and that he regretted not having stipulated
for velvet and diamonds. But the picture
had brought fresh fame to the artist; crowds of
admirers gathering round the 'Morning Star,' as it
was called, when it was on view at the Academy,
though it was generally believed to be an ideal
rather than a portrait. To Lilian it was a priceless
treasure.</p>

<p>Mrs Tipper was in the outset a little afraid lest
Lilian should do too much for her strength; but
she presently took my hint and objected no more.
I kept Lilian at work with me until we were both
too fairly tired out to be able to indulge in any
sentimental regrets. Two or three days passed
thus, hammering and nailing in the mornings,
chintz-cover making in the afternoons; in a
steady, methodical, business-like fashion, until
it was evident that very soon there would be
nothing left for us to do, if Mrs Tipper and
Becky remained firm in their determination not
to allow us to give them any assistance in the
everyday work of the house.</p>

<p>When our work was at length completed, we
flattered ourselves that a prettier room than the
cottage parlour was not to be found in all the
country round. The pictures and china, Lilian's
easel and pet books and birds, the pretty chintz
furniture, and the rare flowers which found their
way to us, did indeed form a very charming whole&mdash;a
room which looked a great deal more like the
home of a gentlewoman than did any of the rooms
at Fairview; the latter being too gorgeous in the
way of gilding and upholstery to be fitting receptacles
for works of art.</p>

<p>I was not a little amused at Miss Farrar's very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">{260}</a></span>
openly expressed astonishment, when, about a
fortnight after our departure from Fairview, she
found time for making the promised call upon
us.</p>

<p>'Well!' she involuntarily exclaimed; 'you <i>have</i>
made it look pretty!' presently adding&mdash;'for a
cottage, you know. I am sure you need not mind
any one coming to see you here. I shouldn't mind
living here myself, I really shouldn't! I cannot
think how you have contrived to make it look so
<i>comy fo</i>!'</p>

<p>Then she a little curiously asked to be shewn
the rest of the house. And although all our art
treasures had been gathered together in this one
room, she found that the other part of the house
was well and prettily furnished; an air of comfort
if not of luxury pervading every nook and corner;
nothing being wanting from garret to cellar. In
fact there had been no lack of means; Mrs Tipper
had money enough and to spare for the furnishing,
without drawing upon Lilian's two hundred and
fifty pounds received for the piano. It had turned
out there were some hundreds lying in Mrs Tipper's
name at the banker's. She had not taken her
brother's words so literally as he intended them
to be taken; drawing barely sixty or seventy
pounds a year of the two hundred which had
been settled upon her; and consequently it had
been left to accumulate; and as she smilingly
explained, Mr Markham informed her there was
quite a little fortune awaiting her. 'So I've
been saving up a fortune without knowing it,
you see, dears: it isn't everybody that does
that.' Then, in a softer tone: 'Poor Jacob would
be glad to know that his generosity to me
will help his child.' Then seeing Lilian's colour
rise as she looked up with tear-dimmed eyes
at her mother's portrait, and perhaps perceiving
something of the thought which occasioned the
emotion, the dear little woman went on pleadingly
and in a low voice: 'Sometimes I think that <i>her</i>
love will plead for him. I am sure that his love
and kindness to his sister will.'</p>

<p>Marian peeped in everywhere, and even found a
gracious word for Becky, though I am sorry to say
it was most ungraciously received. I do not wish
to lower Becky in the eyes of my readers, and
therefore I will only say that for a few moments
she returned to the manners of <i>court-life</i>, in replying
to Miss Farrar's gracious little speech.</p>

<p>'What a deal it must have cost!' again and
again ejaculated Marian. 'And how hard you
must have worked to get it to look like this!'</p>

<p>'It has amused us,' I smilingly replied.</p>

<p>'And a piano too!'</p>

<p>'Yes; that made its appearance yesterday; a
present from an unknown friend;' adding a little
mischievously, for in truth I more than guessed
that friend to be Robert Wentworth: 'Was it a
kind thought of yours, Miss Farrar?'</p>

<p>She was obliged to confess that it was not;
though she did not omit to imply that she considered
she had already done enough, and more
than enough, in the way of 'kind thoughts.'
Lilian's quiet self-contained bearing seemed not a
little to astonish her. She had, I fancy, expected
to find her in a lachrymose state. So at a loss was
she to account for it, that she presently asked me
in a whisper whether we had had a visit from Mr
Trafford. I replied in the negative; and in her
satisfaction she was so far off her guard as to say:
'Caroline said he hadn't been.' And she turned
to Lilian again more gracious than ever.</p>

<p>She really meant to be kind, and looked disappointed
as well as surprised at Lilian's persistent
refusal to go to stay at Fairview, though she had
had time to feel the difference between her former
home and the cottage.</p>

<p>'But you really must not bury yourself in this
small place; and it would be so nice for you, you
know, having drives and all that. And there's
your horse&mdash;I won't sell it, if you would like to
ride again. I wish I wasn't so frightened of horses.
Caroline says I should look splendid in a habit.'</p>

<p>'I should not care to ride now, thank you.'</p>

<p>'But you must come and stay. We are going
to have all sorts of gaieties by-and-by; as soon
as the new servants are in training. Caroline
knows lots of great people; and we will have
dinners, and balls, and fêtes, and all sorts of
things. Of course you must come.'</p>

<p>'No; you are very kind&mdash;I am sure you mean
to be kind&mdash;but I could not. I do not care for
such things. I prefer the cottage and cottage-life,'
gently but decidedly returned Lilian.</p>

<p>But that was quite beyond Marian's comprehension.
She was convinced that there was some
other cause for the refusal. It was impossible to
really prefer living in a small cottage. After a
few moments' reflection, she said: 'You are not
annoyed about Caroline being with me, are you?
You know you all left me alone, and'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'Annoyed? No, indeed!' very decidedly replied
Lilian. 'Why should I be?'</p>

<p>'Well, of course it's rather awkward your
having broken it off with Mr&mdash;Trafford; Caroline
says you have now, quite?' with a keen questioning
glance. Lilian made no reply. She had indeed
done nothing towards the 'breaking off,'
only tacitly submitted to it. After waiting a few
moments, and waiting in vain, Marian went on:
'But if you do not care about having him now, I
don't see why you should object to meeting him
occasionally. Indeed I do not know how I can
forbid him to come to Fairview. There can be no
objection to his coming to see his sister sometimes.'</p>

<p>'I do not see any,' quietly returned Lilian.</p>

<p>Whereat Marian looked very much relieved;
and became so extremely gracious and affectionate
towards us, that Mrs Tipper, who had not been
much noticed of late, was taken into favour
again.</p>

<p>'And I shall expect to see you too, aunt. I
know you do not care for company; but you
might come on the quiet days, when we are <i>quite</i>
alone. I will let you know, the first leisure'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'You must excuse me,' put in Mrs Tipper
with gentle dignity; 'I have given up visiting.
I may make an occasional call; but, like Lilian, I
very much prefer my present humble home to
Fairview&mdash;now.'</p>

<p>'It's very good of you to bear it so well, I'm
sure; but you can't <i>really</i> prefer it, I think.
Besides, you are my real aunt now, you know;
and if you don't come it will look as if'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'You must excuse me if I sometimes forget our
relationship, Miss Marian' (never could Mrs Tipper
be induced to give her the name of Farrar). 'My
Lilian is the only niece I have known until very
recently, and my love was all given to her long
ago.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">{261}</a></span></p>

<p>But <i>one</i> thing had put Marian into a good-humour
with herself and us, and she was not to
be discountenanced. I think she good-naturedly
made allowance for us, as disappointed and soured
people, from whom a little ungraciousness might
cheerfully be borne, by one so much more fortunate.
So she took leave of us in the pleasantest
way, and with a pretty wonder at our philosophy
under difficulties; which proved that she had
already become an apt pupil of Mrs Chichester's.</p>

<p>Aided by a natural self-complacency and obtuseness,
and disturbed by no misgiving respecting
her own powers, she would probably very soon
become as perfect a specimen of fine-ladyhood as
she could desire to be. The difference between a
fine lady and a gentlewoman would never be perceived
by Miss Farrar.</p>

<p>One return visit we decided that it was necessary
to force ourselves to pay. We felt <i>that</i> much
was only right and proper, if only to evince that
we harboured no unkindliness towards the new
mistress of Fairview. But it was not pleasant to
anticipate; and in our desire to get it over, we
were as prompt as Miss Farrar could desire in
returning her call, setting forth for Fairview the
next day. Could she have heard us comforting
and sustaining each other by the way, she would
probably have been less flattered.</p>

<p>We were admitted and ushered into the drawing-room
by a strange servant in very gorgeous
livery. It was to be a greater trial for poor Lilian
than I had expected. I do not think that either of
us had calculated upon the possibility of finding
Arthur Trafford upon familiar terms at Fairview
at so early a date as this after Lilian's departure.
But there he was; and as Marian was singing at
the top of her voice when we were ushered into
the room, we had a momentary picture of them as
they certainly would not have chosen us to see
them; her eyes being raised to his, and his bent
upon hers, with all the <i>empressement</i> of lovers,
before they became conscious of our presence. Mrs
Chichester was seated at a sufficient distance, near
one of the open windows, apparently deeply immersed
in the subject treated in a book she was
reading.</p>

<p>'Good gracious!' ejaculated Marian, rising
hastily from the music-stool as she caught sight
of us.</p>

<p>Lilian shrank back a moment, and for that
moment I contrived to screen her from observation.
Fortunately the others were too much confused
at being so discovered, to notice how we
bore ourselves; and Lilian very quickly recovered
herself again and advanced towards Marian. Presently
we were all shaking hands and saying the
right thing for the occasion.</p>

<p>Marian was extremely effusive about our goodness
in coming 'so very <i>soon</i>;' partly, I fancied,
to conceal a little embarrassment which she had
the grace to feel. 'We did not expect you to be
<i>quite</i> so good as <i>this</i>, you know, dear!' she ejaculated,
kissing Lilian.</p>

<p>Arthur Trafford was the least at ease. When
the rest of us had contrived to assume an everyday
tone and manner, he seemed to be growing
still more confused and conscious. It was certainly
rather embarrassing, for a man so desirous as he of
others' good opinion, to be found thus&mdash;assuming
the attitude of a lover towards Marian Farrar, by
the girl whom he had deserted; and so soon after
that desertion. The motive was too palpable to
be glossed over by any amount of sophistry. To
add to his misery, he still loved the girl he had
deserted.</p>

<p>The sight of Lilian's white face and grave eyes&mdash;the
traces of the storm which had swept over her&mdash;was
too much for him. He stood gazing at her
with miserable yearning eyes; and when she presently
addressed a few words to him with reference
to a book of his to which Marian had drawn
her attention, thanking him for the loan of it, and
asking him to excuse her having in the hurry of
leaving Fairview forgotten to return it, he could
endure the torture no longer.</p>

<p>Hurriedly thrusting aside his sister, who had
perceived something of what was going on in his
mind, and was coming to the rescue, he went out
of one of the windows opening to the ground, and
we saw him striding down one of the garden paths,
as though his only object was to get out of sight
as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>Marian looked uneasy as well as annoyed; and
watched Lilian more closely, not a little astonished,
I think, at her self-possession. There was an
awkward silence for a few moments; until Mrs
Chichester came to the rescue, and steered us into
the shallows again, making talk about nothing, in
easy society fashion, until we had all recovered
our equilibrium.</p>

<p>Dear little Mrs Tipper came out grandly again;
no longer attempting anything in the way of
company manners, they saw her as she was, a
single-minded, true-hearted woman, with a great
deal of natural dignity and self-respect. Utterly
disregarding Marian's shocked looks and Mrs
Chichester's half-suppressed smiles, she talked
about her cottage home and new life with very unmistakable
thankfulness for the change which had
come about, so far as she was concerned. They
had led to it by their compassionate tone, and they
could not doubt the sincerity of her replies.</p>

<p>'You mean to be kind, no doubt, ma'am;' in
reply to one of Mrs Chichester's polite little speeches.
'But I assure you that as for myself I am more
happy and comfortable at the cottage than I have
been for many a long day. I was not brought up
like gentlefolks, and their ways never came easy
to me. My father was a green-grocer, and a very
good father he was&mdash;I am proud of my father, Mrs
Chichester&mdash;and though he could not make his
children like rich people's children, he taught us
not to be ashamed of being what we were. If you
don't like your station in life, get out of it as soon
as you like; but don't be ashamed of it while you
<i>are</i> in it. That is what father used to say; and
there was not a tradesman in Camberwell more
respected than father was. Jacob worked his way
up in the world; but by the time he had got rich
it was too late to make <i>me</i> any different.' Smiling
at Mrs Chichester's graceful little protest, she cheerfully
went on: 'We have none of us been brought
up like gentlefolks; and we can't help its shewing.
Why any one might see that Lilian is a lady, like
her mother before her, and different from such as
us, you know;' with a confidential nod towards
Marian. 'I once thought that learning French
and the piano would do it; but I know better
now.'</p>

<p>Marian drew herself up with a few murmured
words to the effect that the mistress of Fairview
was quite equal to the position she found herself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">{262}</a></span>
in. But it was of no avail. She was not a gentlewoman
in Mrs Tipper's eyes; and Mrs Chichester
herself was but a poor imitation of one.</p>

<p>'It is not, I think, usual to find&mdash;Camberwell
so ready to recognise the claims of birth, Mrs
Tipper,' said Mrs Chichester, with the extreme
softness which generally accompanied such little
speeches from her lips. 'Blue blood is not supposed
to reign there.'</p>

<p>'I was not talking about blue blood, ma'am,'
returned Mrs Tipper, complacently regarding her.
'Lilian's mother was a gentlewoman;' at which
Marian, who had taken offence at Mrs Chichester's
remark on her own account, gave it as her opinion
that 'blue' blood was all nonsense, and she had
never believed in it.</p>

<p>I sat silent, admiring the way in which Mrs
Tipper and Lilian shewed their ability to hold
their own. Mrs Chichester was inclined to be
loftily condescending towards me; but as I met
her with smiling cheerfulness, shewing no sign of
being aware of my inferiority, the conversation
soon languished between us.</p>

<p>Marian did her very best to be kind and conciliating
towards Lilian. 'Now you have broken
the ice, you will come very often, I hope, dear. It
is rather a fatiguing walk up the hill; but there's
the carriage always at your service. Of course
you will let me send you back now;' going
towards the bell as we rose to take leave. 'What
<i>I</i> should do without a carriage I really don't
know,' she added languidly.</p>

<p>We hurriedly declined the carriage, each very
decidedly affirming a predilection for walking
exercise; and finding that we were really in
earnest, she reluctantly allowed us to depart as we
came.</p>

<p>'There; it is over; and we need not go again for
ever so long, I am thankful to say!' ejaculated
Mrs Tipper with a sigh of relief as we turned
homewards.</p></div>

<div class='article'>
<h2><a name="SEA-SHORE_RAMBLES" id="SEA-SHORE_RAMBLES">SEA-SHORE RAMBLES.</a></h2>


<p>'<span class="smcap">Where</span> are you going this year?' is a question
that meets every one just now, and is suggestive of
coming holidays, when the daily work, be it what
it may, is put by for a season, and the tired brain
is to be rested and refreshed by more or less
change of scene and fresh air. 'Where are you
going?' suggests to some perhaps the aspirations
of an Alpine climber; to the angler, the joys of
uninterrupted days of patient watching by the side
or in the middle of a limpid stream in one of our
home counties, or in the rougher and more exciting
rivers of Scotland and Wales. The schoolboy
thinks of long rambles in the fields and woods,
or a cruise on the river; whilst Pater and Mater
familias consider how best to give rosy cheeks and
a month's delight to the little faces clustering
round their table. It is chiefly this class of holiday-makers
that we have in our minds whilst we
cogitate the hints in these pages.</p>

<p>Not that the enjoyment of a sea-side ramble is
by any means confined to the young of the household.
Nothing is more refreshing to the breadwinner
of a family than the perfect absence of
restraint and sense of freedom which every well-chosen
exodus to the sea-side should produce.
Instead of the daily hurried breakfast and rush
to catch the train or omnibus which takes him
to his office or place of business, there is the
leisurely and comfortable meal by the side of
the open window, through which the sea-breezes
waft, bringing health and vigour with them. The
voices of children from the beach, full of life
and joy, as they build their castles of sand
and dig moats for the water to undermine them,
are music to the ears usually half-deafened by
the sound of cabs and wagons and the noise of
crowded thoroughfares; and we do not wonder
that there are many who, though they might go
farther if they chose, prefer rather the perfect
repose and pure sea-breezes of one of our British
sea-coast villages. Perhaps after a few days of
this delicious sensation of rest and no hurry, the
very want of occupation may pall on the spirit of
an active man; and he may find that to sweep
over the horizon with a telescope, to sail in a
boat, to lounge or loll on a shingly beach, varied
by trials of skill in throwing stones into the sea,
cannot bear constant repetition without a suspicion
of dullness, and that after all he wants something
more to do.</p>

<p>The task we propose to ourselves is to suggest
what can be done at the sea-side likely to interest
and please those who, though not naturalists, are
intelligent observers, and who believe in the old
proverb, that 'Change of work is as good as play.'
The young ones of the household soon become
interested in fresh pursuits, and are eager to collect
materials for an aquarium, or to commence a botanical
collection; or perhaps to search for pebbles,
shells, or fossils, if their quarters lie in some
favourable position. We will suppose an intelligent
mother and father who are not naturalists,
who do not boast of any scientific letters after
their name, and who belong to none of the
learned societies of our land, who yet when at
home read the current journals and literature of
the day, occasionally attend lectures, and believe
that the pursuit of science is interesting as well as
useful. Perhaps they may have a medical friend
or neighbour who is almost sure to possess a
microscope, with which he not only is wont to
make pathological investigations, but to interest
and amuse his friends. He will often exhibit the
circulation of sap in a fresh-water plant leaf, perhaps
even the circulation of blood in a frog's foot;
and many are the pretty objects afforded by the
hairs of a leaf, the sections of a stem, or the wings
of a beetle. But if by chance this same microscope
be transported to the sea-side, with its proper
arrangements for the examination of living organisms,
the variety and charm to be derived from its
use are endless. Almost every drop of sea-water
teems with animal life; and an inch of sea-weed
will produce tiny shells, animalcules, and curious
forms under the microscope invisible to the naked
eye. Then the very water brought from the sea
and supplied fresh for the morning bath, or carried
home by the little ones in their tiny pails with
such delight, half-filled with sea-weed, will often
afford such marvels in the shape of zoophytes, or
tiny jelly-fishes, as only those can imagine who can
recollect their first sight of such wonders under
the microscope.</p>

<p>It is very possible that the young ones of such
a household as we imagine, are the first to excite
inquiry as to the objects around them. They are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">{263}</a></span>
sure to make friends in their sea-side rambles. The
boys will be attracted by some gray-headed old
gentleman who goes 'sugaring for moths;' or some
crusty old geologist who pulls down the cliffs to
get at some coveted fossil, or sits on the beach
cracking flints to examine their formation, and
delights to give a history of their growth to a
youthful audience. The little girls of a family
party will to a certainty bring home sea-weeds
and sea-shore plants in their baskets, and delightedly
take in anything they can learn about
them. Father and mother begin to think that
after all there is a great deal at the sea-side they
do not understand, and ignorant as they are, it is
not pleasant to confess it all to the youngsters;
so a visit is paid to the bookseller for certain
books of reputation, such as Gosse's <i>Year at the
Shore</i>; and study begins in earnest.</p>

<p>After a while, the superior intelligence of the
elders enables them to master many minor subjects
of interest, and to put them in the position of
instructors to the children, who are sure to follow
them up with avidity. In a little time a sort of
extempore aquarium is likely to be formed in the
sitting-room or on the outside balcony, if there be
one. We can see the row of soup-plates and pie-dishes
which serve as domestic rock-pools for
their inhabitants. Paterfamilias gets much interested
in these, and is found to wait more patiently
than usual for the brewing of his morning cup of
tea whilst he examines the curious creatures thus
imported into his presence. Poking up a sluggish
sea-anemone, clearing off dead bits of sea-weed,
or removing some unpleasant defunct mollusc,
occupies these normally irritating intervals of
time. After breakfast, whilst placidly enjoying
the fragrant weed, so delicious to the smoker
at the sea-side, the boys, who have often seen
the fun, inaugurate a battle-royal between two
hermit crabs, who, being the very cuckoos of
the sea, spend their lives in the shells of other
creatures, and have no rightful dwelling-place
of their own. The scientific name of the hermit
crab is <i>Pagurus</i>, but unlike other members
of his class, he has only a portion of his
body incased in armour. His hind-parts are soft,
covered only by a delicate membrane; but his
nature is warlike; and could he not by his own
ingenuity supply the wrong done him by Nature,
he would fare ill in this combative world; accordingly,
he selects an empty shell of convenient
size, into which he pops his tender tail, fastening
on by hooks on each side, and having thus secured
his rear, he scuttles over the sea-bed, a grotesque
but philosophic marauder. The impossibility of
Pagurus living long without a covering to his
extremity is taken advantage of by young and
fun-loving naturalists. Selecting two nearly of a
size, and removing them from their appropriated
shells, they are dropped into a vase of sea-water,
and one of the shells, usually a whelk-shell, is
placed between them, first breaking off the point of
the shell. At once the skirmish begins. One
makes direct for the shell, and having first poked
in an inquiring claw and found all safe, slips in
his tail, and fastening on by his hooks, scuttles
away rejoicing. In the case we recall, he was not
left long in undisturbed possession. His rival
approached with strictly dishonourable intentions,
and they both walked round and round the vase,
eyeing each other with malignity. No exhibition
ever produced more laughter than this amusing
and after all, harmless combat, which lasted a full
half-hour. The skirmish only terminated when
another shell more perfect than the original one
was thrown into the water, and the tender tail of
the inhabitant poked, so as to make him vacate
and enter the new abode, leaving the dilapidated
shell to shelter his enemy, who made the best of
it, curled up his tail, and reposed in peace after
his fatiguing campaign.</p>

<p>In a very short time aquariums multiply, books
are read, and excursions are organised to various
rock-pools and silent sea-caves, where it is said
curious creatures from the deep may be found and
secured. We have already in former papers said
much about the inhabitants of sea-water aquaria;
but the variety that can be found and retained and
studied in a temporary arrangement at the sea-coast
is much greater than any collection which
will bear transportation and town-life. At the sea-side,
if one lovely anemone should sicken and fade,
it can be removed at once, thrown back into its
native element to have a chance of recovery, and its
place easily supplied. Queer little fishes which
lurk under stones will often live for a long time
in a pan of water; and one we once kept in this
way had individual habits and ways which were
most amusing. After swimming about for some
time in an inverted propagating glass resting in a
flower-pot, he would sink to the bottom, and then
curling his tail round him as a cat would do when
making herself comfortable, he would look up with
his unabashed eyes and pant away, as if fatigued
with his gambols. It was in the evening we caught
him, and he was then in full black&mdash;evening
costume; but next morning we found him arrayed
in an entire suit of light brown&mdash;cool morning-dress.
In the afternoon he again assumed his
black appearance.</p>

<p>An excellent plan in the country or the sea-side
is to persuade and encourage the children of the
household to keep a diary. Everything, however
humble in the scale of creation, is worth observing
and watching, and is worth recording for after-reference.
The motions of a beetle or a butterfly;
the flight or song of a bird; the burrowing habits
of the mole; the evolutions of a shoal of porpoises;
or the commotion betrayed by sea-birds when the
herring appear, are each and all worthy a place in
the observer's diary. For by such recordings have
great works on natural history been given to the
world. There are several hours in the heat of
the day when to be on the beach or indeed out
of shelter is impossible, and we have often found,
it difficult to suggest employment for these hours
at all consistent with the holiday spirit which
pervades everything at the sea-side. Lessons
are voted a nuisance and a bore; drying sea-weed
and pressing plants found in the evening
walks soon becomes tiring; but keeping a diary
and chronicling the events of each day is something
which seems to carry the interest of the
holiday-time with it, and is pleasant to refer to
afterwards. The capture of special sea-creatures,
their habits and progress, perhaps their death, may
be recorded, besides the names of other animals or
plants seen or brought home. This, to be accurate,
necessitates a little search in such books as may be
handy; and the bodily rest so induced is often a
great boon to the little folks, who fancy they never
feel tired, but get hot and feverish sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">{264}</a></span>
through overdoing it. We have such a diary
before us now, and the first entry is suggestive:
'<i>August 10.</i>&mdash;Last night the sea was all on fire;
we were just going to bed when papa called out
that we might go on to the beach with him; and
there were lines of bright light all along the waves.
We threw handfuls of pebbles in, and the light
shot out brighter, almost like fire-works. Papa
called it <i>phosphorescence</i>; and to-day we saw all
about it under the microscope, and read about it
in Mr Gosse's book. It turns out not to be fire at
all, but a curious little jelly-fish, which makes this
light. I ran with my pail and got some of the
water where the light was; and this morning
papa put it under the microscope, and we saw
one of the tiny little jelly-fishes which made the
brightness.'</p>

<p>Of course this appearance is not uncommon on a
smooth sea in hot weather, and many have been
the conjectures as to its cause. Our little naturalist
is right in the main; but phosphorescence is not
caused solely by the presence of one species of
jelly-fish, but of various kinds of decaying
organisms.</p>

<p>A little hand-net made of muslin slung over the
side of a boat will often secure numbers of these
lovely transparent creatures. 'A tiny beautiful
glass-drop!' cries one of the baby naturalists as
she looks at a perfect little <i>Beroe</i> floating in the
sea-water drawn up in her little wooden pail.
'See!' says mamma, 'how the sunshine changes
its colours, and how curiously it is fringed with
tiny hairs, which keep moving to and fro.' Nothing
can be more graceful than the movements
of this beautiful little creature. A little crystal
sphere, delicately striped, and marked with two
long tentacles or filaments attached to it, which
are in truth its fishing apparatus, and are fringed
with slender fibres, which contract and expand
apparently at will, seeking for the delicate morsels
of food which support the life of this ethereal-like
creature.</p>

<p>Then on our southern coasts, in the Isle of
Wight and elsewhere, we have found other forms
of Medusæ, even more charming. The pretty
little <i>Turris neglecta</i> was constantly caught in the
muslin-net one year. It is like a tiny crystal bell,
with an elegant white fringe around it and a bright
red coral bead in its centre. The <i>Sarsia prolifera</i>,
so funnily described by that humorous and genial
naturalist, the late Professor Edward Forbes, is a
remarkable instance of the way in which the
young ones bud or sprout off from the parent
Medusa at certain seasons of the year.</p>

<p>When Professor Forbes wrote his book on the
Medusæ, much remained to be worked out and
discovered of their nature and organism. He
threw out hints of their probable nature, which
have been followed up by later naturalists; and no
one would have rejoiced more than himself had
he lived to see that his own conclusions were not
final, but merely the beginning of discoveries
which had to be carried on. The whole history of
their development would form an interesting subject
of thought and investigation for many a long
day at the sea-side.</p>

<p>But in seeking for materials for the diaries of
our young folks, much that is new and interesting
is sure to turn up. One child devotes herself to
sea-weeds. She brings them home in her little
basket, floats them out in a saucer of fresh-water,
and gently introduces half a sheet of note-paper
underneath the spray of weed. Carefully lifting
it up out of the water, the sea-weed displays itself
gracefully on the white paper. If any of the little
fronds are out of place, they are gently arranged
by means of a camel-hair pencil brush. A bit of
linen is laid over the sea-weed, and it is placed
between sheets of botanical drying-paper under a
press or heavy weight; next day the drying-paper
is changed; and in a few days the sea-weed will
have dried on its sheet of note-paper and become
quite fast. The piece of linen must be carefully
removed and the particular specimen named, if it
can be identified.</p>

<p>In the diary of our little sea-weed collector we
find written: 'In looking for sea-weeds to-day, I
found a great many things which I thought were
sea-weeds at first, and I tried to dry them in the
same way. They were much thicker, however,
and would not dry so easily; and I was told they
were zoophytes or animals, and not plants or sea-weeds
at all. One of them is quite fleshy, and is
like a sponge, only very small. I find in Patterson's
book that very likely it is really a sponge.'
Well done! little naturalist; many an older and
wiser head than yours has puzzled over the plant-like
appearance of a zoophyte; and surely the
history of a sponge from its first stage as a little
gemmule to its death and decay in the interior of
a flinty sepulchre formed by its own substance,
would not be a wearisome lesson. Every department
of science is so dependent on another, that
no one can now claim to be a good geologist, or
botanist, or anatomist who does not know at least
something of the other branches of natural history.
The rough sketch we have given of some of the
occupations and pursuits which may add to the
charm of a sea-side visit, is but suggestive of much
that cannot be entered upon.</p>

<p>The botany of the sea-coast is special and
peculiar, and will repay careful attention. Nowhere
else do we see the lovely tamarisk trees
forming bright green hedges with their pretty
white flowers. The horn-poppy too (<i>Glaucum
luteum</i>), with its sea-green leaves and brilliant
yellow flower; the sea-holly (<i>Eryngium maritimum</i>)
bristling and prickling even through a sea-shore
boot; and on the slopes and sandy downs near the
sea the beautiful <i>Convolvulus soldenella</i>, with its
trailing stem and pretty pink flowers; the tiny sea-shore
rose (<i>Rosa spinosissima</i>), the origin of all the
garden varieties of Scotch roses, its stems often not
rising more than a few inches from the sand in
which it grows. Then there is the jointed and
fleshy <i>Salicornia</i>, so characteristic of the sea-shore;
and the aromatic samphire, only seen growing
dangerously on almost inaccessible cliffs. Nowhere
have we ever studied the names and habits of
plants with the pleasure and enthusiasm we have
at the sea-side; partly perhaps, owing to the holiday
sensation that must always be associated with
the noise of the rushing waves over their shingly
bed, in the minds of those who never hear it but
when they have thrown work aside for a while.
Memories never to be forgotten crowd into the
heart at the sight of some well-remembered little
plant, growing just where it did thirty years ago,
when we were young and enthusiastic, and ready
to learn all that we could of the beautiful world,
which then seemed made for our delight.</p>

<p>If it ever were the case that the experience of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">{265}</a></span>
one could be expected to guide others, we would
say: Let your young folks read but little during
their sea-side holiday; but observe much; write
down what they see, and confirm and correct their
observations by reference to any good recognised
text-book, many of which are now published.
The brain will thus get rest, or at least change of
work, and will return to its ordinary duties with
redoubled vigour and refreshment. The education
of our children is now more than ever a puzzling
question, and how best to teach them to use their
hours of relaxation is involved in it. The naturalist
spirit engendered, perhaps, by early rambles
on the sea-shore is one to be preciously guarded
and cultivated in future life; and those who have
most carefully and wisely studied human nature
and its tendencies agree as to its beneficial influence
on the character.</p>

<p>The suggestions we have thrown together, imperfect
as they are, may serve to shew that a sea-side
ramble may be made just what the seeker for
pleasure chooses it shall be. For the schoolboy
and philosopher alike, there is something to be
studied and much to be wondered at and admired
in every rock-pool, on every mountain-side.</p></div>

<p class='p3'>IN TWO PARTS.</p>

<p class='p2'>PART II.&mdash;CLOUD.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER III.&mdash;TOO BAD OF MR SCAMPLIN.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Ten</span> o'clock on the following morning found
our party arrived at Dambourne station. It had
been arranged that Angela and her brother should
spend a long day with Isaac, and if nothing particular
were found to be the matter, that he should
return with them to town in the evening. On
alighting from the train, they started off for Isaac's
lodgings at Dambourne End, with the intention of
looking at the cottages and garden-ground on their
way. As they neared the entrance to the court in
which Isaac's property was situated, Herbert could
not but notice the sidelong glances which were
bestowed upon them by the neighbouring inhabitants.
He concluded they were caused by the
presence of strangers. Isaac apparently did not
observe them. But as the party proceeded up
the court itself, the manifestations of interest in
their presence became more striking. A group of
children who were playing, scampered off at their
approach, calling at the top of their voices: 'Ere
him come.'</p>

<p>Herbert glanced inquiringly at Isaac, who was
looking very complacent. Indeed he accepted
this greeting as a sign of the welcome of his
tenants on his return to them. As for Angela, she
was too busily engaged in picking her way through
the large amount of 'matter in the wrong place'
with which the court was encumbered, to have
much attention to spare for other purposes. For
it must be confessed that although its owner had
always been an assiduous landlord so far as the
collection of rents was concerned, he had not been
so assiduous in the improvement of the property
either by disbursement, precept, or otherwise.</p>

<p>The children's shouts brought a number of
slatternly women to their doors, and poor Isaac's
complacency was somewhat rudely disturbed by
one virago exclaiming: 'Well, you skinflint, are
these some more agents come to look after your
dirty cottages?' And by another following up
with: 'Ah, you'll just have to dub up some of the
money you've screwed out of us, ye ugly stingy
thief!'</p>

<p>Isaac was thunder-struck. He had always been
received by his tenants with civility, if not exactly
with respect; and here was a position in which to
be placed before his intended bride! But matters
it seemed were not to stop here; for from every
turning and from every door angry and bold-faced
women emerged. And if things assumed a
more hostile shape, as they appeared on the point
of doing, the interior of the court would not be
a good place from whence to beat a retreat; for if
its owner was a Webb, this court was undoubtedly
a labyrinth. So with that discretion which is the
better part of valour, Isaac hastily muttering
'Let's get away from these blackguards,' fairly
turned tail and fled. And not a minute too soon;
for he carried away two splashes of mud upon his
back, and Angela a portion of a pailful of soap-suds
upon her bonnet, as souvenirs of their (soon to
be) joint estate.</p>

<p>Without further adventure, Mrs Clappen's shop
was reached; and as soon as that lady had got
over her first shock of surprise at the sight of
Angela, who she imagined was Mrs Webb, and
whom she addressed accordingly, she proceeded to
throw some light upon the cause of Isaac's reception
by his tenantry. Some of them were customers
of hers, and she had heard from them all the
'particularities,' as she called them&mdash;namely, that
Mr Scamplin had very soon after his arrival paid
a visit to the cottagers, had announced himself as
Mr Webb's agent during his absence from home,
and had shewn a paper purporting to be signed by
that gentleman, authorising him to act as such;
said he had received instructions to give notice
that from that day week all the rents were to be
raised; had diligently received the rents each
week up to the very day before his disappearance,
sympathising apparently with the tenants in what
he called their harsh treatment by his employer,
and in their inability to give immediate notice to
quit, owing to the scarcity of cottages in the town;
and had otherwise contrived that the onus of these
hard measures should fall upon Isaac's devoted
head.</p>

<p>An inspection of the box shewed that everything
had been turned out of it and the cash
removed, but that fortunately the title-deeds and
other documents had been replaced. A consultation
was held, and it was decided that Angela and
her brother should return to town, and that Isaac
should remain to set matters right with his tenants.
Herbert advised that the robbery should be allowed
to pass, since there was no clue as to Mr Scamplin's
movements on his leaving the neighbourhood, and
extra trouble and expense would be caused by
communicating with the police. So in the evening
Isaac accompanied his friends to the railway
station, carefully choosing a route as distant as
possible from the obnoxious court. After their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">{266}</a></span>
departure, he called on his friend Mr Jones, and
requested that gentleman to pay another visit to
the tenants and explain to them the mistake that
had been made. This, after some hesitation, Mr
Jones consented to do.</p>

<p>But Isaac's cup was not yet full. He had no
sooner arrived at his lodgings than he received a
visit from the sanitary officer, who pointed out to
him some very necessary alterations and improvements
which <i>must</i> be made in the court and without
loss of time; and at Isaac's inquiry, estimating
the probable cost at about a hundred
pounds.</p>

<p>Poor Isaac! the cloud is rather heavy; but the
sunlight of Angela and an income of six hundred
a year and more expectations, is streaming behind
it.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER IV.&mdash;WEBB VICE ASHTON.</h3>

<p>Isaac took no further notice of the robbery, and
nothing more was heard of the thief. Mr Jones's
attempts at pacification were tolerably successful,
and the greater number of Isaac's tenants remained
in their cottages on the old terms. At the end
of three weeks, Herbert paid Isaac a visit, and
received from him the five hundred pounds, for
which he gave a receipt, which our hero deposited
in his box.</p>

<p>Isaac had wondered several times about young
Ashton, and whether Angela had seen or heard
anything of him; so he asked Herbert about
him.</p>

<p>'He left London,' he answered, 'immediately
after he heard of Angela's engagement with you;
and the ball we were going to was given up.'</p>

<p>'Poor young man!' exclaimed Isaac compassionately.</p>

<p>'Depend upon it he envies you your success,'
said Herbert. 'And now what are you going to do
with yourself all the time between this and the
wedding?' he asked.</p>

<p>'I have these alterations in the court to see
after; and I want to have matters straight for
Jones, as I shall put the management of things in
his hands when I go away for good. But get over
your preparations as fast as you can, Herbert, for
I shall be glad to be settled; and unless you want
me for anything, I will stay here until I go up to
London for the&mdash;the wedding.' Isaac brought the
last word out with a jerk.</p>

<p>Herbert promised to make all possible haste, and
said he would write to Isaac in the course of a
week or so. This latter promise he fulfilled by
sending Isaac word that he knew of a very
desirable house at Brixton; but it could only be
obtained by the purchase of the lease. He requested
Isaac to let him know by return of post or
the chance would be lost, and it was such a bargain.
He had spent the greater part of the five hundred
pounds on the furniture, which it was desirable to
get into its place soon. Angela had been to see
the house, and was delighted with it. To purchase
the lease and fixtures, two hundred pounds more
would be required, and if Isaac liked to close with
the bargain, that day fortnight would be time
enough for the money. While on the subject of
money, he would ask Isaac to lend him a hundred
pounds for Angela to make the necessary preparations
for her marriage. This he asked on the
strength of a remark that Isaac had once made as
to his entire confidence in him.</p>

<p>Poor Isaac felt with many a twinge, that he
was somehow getting involved. But he felt that
it would be over soon, and that when he and
Angela were married, and he was in possession of
her jointure, he would make up for all this great
expenditure by a little judicious saving; so he
wrote to Herbert to strike the bargain, and said
the three hundred pounds should be ready for him
in a week or ten days.</p>

<p>When Herbert came for the money, his sister
accompanied him. She told Isaac that it was
such a delightful house, and that she was sure
they would be so happy there. She also told
him how deeply she appreciated his confidence in
her brother and herself; and made on the whole
so great an impression upon Isaac, that for once
his heart was really touched. Before his visitors
returned to town that evening, it was decided that
that day month should be the happy one. On
their way to the station the lovers were alone for
a few minutes, when Isaac asked about having the
banns published.</p>

<p>'Oh, I shouldn't like that a bit,' said Angela
gaily. 'How should you like to hear me called
spinster in church? No, no; Herbert must get a
license; you need not bother about that.'</p>

<p>To Isaac it was a matter of so little moment,
that what suited her suited him.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER V.&mdash;WHERE IS THE LICENSE?</h3>

<p>The time for the wedding sped quickly on.
Mr Batfid's establishment was again visited, and
Isaac received a suit of clothes that fitted him,
their maker observed, 'like a gentleman.' Isaac
received several charming letters from his betrothed.
She seemed so happy in the anticipation
of their approaching nuptials and their delightful
home. It was arranged that the wedding should
be a very quiet one. No one was to be present
but the contracting parties themselves; Angela's
brother and a young-lady friend; Mr Jones (Isaac's
best-man); and the officials of the church. They
were to spend their honeymoon in the isle much
frequented by such visitations&mdash;that of Wight;
and Angela wrote word that Herbert had engaged
a respectable couple to take care of the house at
Brixton until their return home.</p>

<p>A few days before the eventful one fixed for the
ceremony, Isaac packed up what few things he
wanted, bade good-bye to Mrs Clappen, told Mr
Jones to be sure to meet him in good time at the
church, and finally started off to his old lodgings&mdash;the
coffee-house at Islington. The next morning
he visited New West Road and accompanied
Angela and her brother to Brixton. The house,
as she had truly described it, was delightful, and
it was, moreover, most charmingly and tastefully
furnished. Isaac was surprised and pleased, though
somewhat alarmed at the (to him) vastness and
grandeur of his new residence. On their return,
he spent the evening at New West Road, and
was treated to some of Angela's songs and (as a
special favour) a private view of the wedding-dress.</p>

<p>'There is one thing to be done, Isaac,' Herbert
said, just as he was leaving; 'you have to put your
name to the transfer of the lease of your house.
However, that can be done when you come back
here after the ceremony.'</p>

<p>Early on his wedding morning, Isaac was up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">{267}</a></span>
and dressed. He could not indeed afford to be
very late, for the ceremony was fixed for ten
o'clock. At nine he suddenly remembered that he
wanted a wedding-ring, so ran as fast as he could
to the nearest jeweller's and bought one, the size
of which he was obliged to chance. His ruling
passion was strong even in these circumstances;
for he contrived to beat the jeweller down a point
in price, and made him promise to exchange the
ring at any future time if it did not fit. He reached
the church (which was close to Miss Faithful's
residence) in good time, and found Herbert outside
waiting to see him. Mr Jones was also in readiness,
and the clergyman had just arrived in the
vestry.</p>

<p>'I am glad you are come, Isaac,' said Herbert.
'I did not ask you about the license. I suppose
you have it all right?'</p>

<p>'No; I haven't it,' answered Isaac.&mdash;'I understood
that you would get it.'</p>

<p>'I? Why, surely you know that it must be
obtained by one of the persons who are about to
use it!'</p>

<p>Herbert was evidently vexed. 'Pray, have you
only come here to make fools of us? I don't
see what other interpretation is to be put on your
conduct.'</p>

<p>'I am very sorry,' said poor Isaac meekly, 'but
I didn't know about it. What can I do?'</p>

<p>'Do!' Herbert returned. 'The only thing you
can do is for you and your friend to get a Hansom
and go to Doctors' Commons as quickly as you
can and get a license, and to be back here as much
before twelve o'clock as possible. Meanwhile we
will go back to the house and wait.'</p>

<p>So a cab was procured, and the bridegroom and
his friend started off. Fortunately Jones had been
to Doctors' Commons before, so that not much
time was lost in its intricacies.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER VI.&mdash;CHECKMATED.</h3>

<p>On their return to the church the sexton was
just about to lock the door, but seeing two gentlemen
approaching, he waited till they came up;
and not having seen them on their former visit
there that morning, he politely asked them if
they wanted to see the church.</p>

<p>'My friend has come here to be married,' said
Jones. 'Where are the other members of the
party?'</p>

<p>'Come to be married, has he? Who was he
going to be married to?'</p>

<p>'Miss Angela Faithful,' said Jones.</p>

<p>'O come, that won't do, you know,' said the
sexton, with a glance at Isaac's tall but ungainly
figure; 'you're not going to gammon <i>me</i>. It's
true she <i>was</i> married this morning, and a pretty
young woman she is, and dressed very handsome
too'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'Yes,' Isaac broke in; 'and where did the money
for it come from?'</p>

<p>'I didn't ask her, and she didn't tell me,'
returned the man, half cross, yet half amused.</p>

<p>'You must have made some mistake, my friend,'
said Jones. 'To whom was the young lady married?'</p>

<p>'I didn't hear his surname; but he was married
in the name of Herbert.'</p>

<p>'That is her brother!' cried Isaac and Jones
together.</p>

<p>'Ah, well; they're husband and wife too, now&mdash;a
sort of double relationship, you see. But I
can't wait here while you take your fun off me
no longer,' the sexton continued. 'So here goes.'
With that he locked the door and walked away.</p>

<p>'Stay!' cried Jones; 'we are not making fun of
you; the matter is far too serious. Where can we
find the clergyman who married them?'</p>

<p>'I can't tell you; he doesn't live hereabouts.
He only took the duty for our gentleman, who is
away for a few days. I believe his name is Smith;
but I've never seen him before, and very likely
shan't ever see him again.'</p>

<p>'Which way did the two go when they left the
church?' Jones asked.</p>

<p>'I was inside, so didn't notice,' answered the
sexton.</p>

<p>Isaac followed his friend down the church path,
and seemed utterly bewildered. But now Jones
appealed to him as to the probable destination
of the pair. Isaac blankly suggested New West
Road; so thither they went. Mrs Glubbs&mdash;Miss
Faithful's care-taker&mdash;answered them. She knew
nothing of Angela's movements, except that she
understood she was gone to be married; to whom
she did not know, but supposed it was to the
young man she was always with&mdash;Mr Herbert.
Could they see Miss Faithful? Yes; certainly, if
they liked; but she would be able to give them
no information; for she could scarcely speak now,
and was well nigh idiotic.</p>

<p>The friends next proceeded to Brixton. A
handsome phaeton was outside Isaac's house, and a
gentleman&mdash;a stranger&mdash;was inside. He received
them very urbanely, and just as though the place
belonged to him.</p>

<p>Upon Jones asking him (for Isaac seemed as
though he were in a dream) his business there,
the gentleman politely returned him the same
question.</p>

<p>'Sir,' said Jones, 'this is my friend's house:
you are under some misconception.'</p>

<p>'Sir,' said the stranger politely, 'you are apparently
labouring under the same difficulty. I
bought this furniture as it stands, these fixtures,
and the lease of this house, the day before yesterday,
and am now legally in possession. Permit
me, however, to remove any doubt by shewing
you these papers. No&mdash;pardon me&mdash;not in your
own hands: you can look over me.'</p>

<p>Yes; the documents were genuine enough; a
proper lease and transfer, and all the rest of it;
but no sign of the name of Isaac Webb. The
stranger said the gentleman of whom he bought
the lease, &amp;c. was a Mr Herbert Ashton, whom he
had not the pleasure of knowing personally; but
the business had been properly conducted on both
sides by respectable solicitors. He believed the
last owner, Mr Ashton, had held the lease but a
very short time.</p>

<p>The friends' next visit was to the police. They
listened patiently to the tale, and calmly said they
did not think much of it. Had the gentleman
any witnesses or papers to prove it? No. Very
well then; what could they, the police, do? The
gentleman <i>might</i> be able to get a warrant; but if
the story were true, the persons who had got the
better of him would know how to keep out of the
way of that; but it was a tale almost impossible
to prove; and for their part they didn't believe
a word of it. The gentleman looked as if he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">{268}</a></span>
insane. It may be remarked that Jones did not
form a very high opinion of the penetration and
intellectual capacity of the police in this matter.
He next tried to persuade Isaac to go and consult
a respectable solicitor; but at this he absolutely
rebelled.</p>

<p>'No, no,' he said; 'it will only cost me a lot
more money.' At that word&mdash;so dear to him&mdash;he
fairly broke down and sobbed aloud. A crowd
began to form; so Jones hailed a cab, and bore
Isaac off to the railway station <i>en route</i> for
Dambourne.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER THE LAST.&mdash;THE MORAL.</h3>

<p>Isaac stayed with his friend Jones until he
began to get over in some measure the shock he
had experienced, when he resumed his old quarters
with Mrs Clappen. After he had been settled there
about a week, he saw in a newspaper the following
announcement: 'On the 10th instant, <span class="smcap">Herbert
Ashton</span>, Esq. to <span class="smcap">Angela</span>, fifth daughter of the late
<span class="smcap">Vincent Faithful</span>, Esq. of London. No cards.'
This was supplemented at the end of another
week by the receipt of the following letter:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr Webb</span>&mdash;Possibly you may think
that some sort of explanation is due to you
from me. I must inform you then, that Herbert
Ashton (whom you have known as Herbert
Faithful) and I have been attached to each
other for some years. The want of a little
money as capital alone prevented our union.
You remember, I daresay, our introduction at
the Holloway ball. On that occasion the idea
first came into my mind to play the part I
have. It occurred to me as I listened to your
conversation with Mr Hoppe, the Master of the
Ceremonies, respecting me and <i>my expectations</i>.
Thanks to you, they are certainly no worse now
than they were then. I mentioned my idea to
Herbert, and he has well helped me to carry it into
effect. The shock to your self-conceit, pride, and
cunning is no doubt severe, but time will assist
you to get over it; and the lesson you have
learned may perhaps be of value to you some day.
Meanwhile endeavour to forget us. It will be
idle to remember us; for we are&mdash;when this
reaches you&mdash;far from the old country. We have
left it and the old name in all probability for ever&mdash;unless
indeed you should ever leave us the
remainder of your property, in which case we
might cross the seas to claim it. And if at any
time chance should cause us to meet it will be but
as strangers, for Herbert was careful to re-possess
himself of all the receipts and documents, that
could be of no use to us where they were. They
are now destroyed. And do not trouble Miss
Faithful with fruitless inquiries. She is not my
aunt, but a distant relation of the same name as
my father. Her property I may tell you goes at
her death to her sister, Mrs Glubbs. We have met
with Mr Scamplin, in whom my husband recognised
an old acquaintance. He is now with us,
and desires to be remembered to you. If you
ever think of your monetary loss&mdash;eight hundred
pounds, was it not?&mdash;remember with pleasure that
it has conduced to my happiness. I am aware
that you intended it to do so, but in a slightly
different way. And now, Mr Webb, good-bye for
ever; and believe me that I shall never forget
you. My dear husband desires his remembrances
to you, and wishes me to say that he forgives you
your rudeness to me at all times, as do I,</p>

<p class='right'>
Yours never very truly,<br />

<h2><a name="AFFECTION_IN_BIRD-LIFE" id="AFFECTION_IN_BIRD-LIFE">AFFECTION IN BIRD-LIFE.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Any</span> one who will watch carefully may soon
perceive that not only pigeons in the court-yard,
sparrows on the roof, crows and magpies in the
wood, and many other birds, always live together
in inseparable pairs; but also that swallows and
various other small birds, when, in the autumn,
they fly about in great swarms previous to migrating,
always keep together affectionately in pairs.
Starlings, crows, and various others, collect together
in the evenings in large numbers on bushes, high
trees, and church roofs for a night's rest; but in the
morning the company resolves itself into pairs,
and during the entire time of flight these pairs
remain together. Several species are the exceptions
to this rule, inasmuch as the two sexes
form into separate companies to prosecute their
migratory flight; this is the case with most of
our summer warblers. The males start, and also
probably return, some days earlier than the
females; but whenever the two sexes have
returned, they mate, and the pairs then formed
are supposed to be of the same individuals as in
previous years.</p>

<p>The fidelity and affectionate intimacy of married
bird-life appears most conspicuously in pairs of the
Grosbeak family and in small parrots. Here is
perfect harmony of will and deed. The two sweethearts
appear unwilling to leave one another's
company for a moment all their life; they do
everything together&mdash;eating and drinking, bathing
and dressing of feathers, sleeping and waking.
Various degrees of affection and harmony are
discernible on close observation. Among the
small grosbeaks, pairs of which sit together, the
intimate relation is never disturbed; even over
the feeding-cup there is no quarrelling. They
stand highest in this respect among birds. Love-tokens
are exchanged by pressing of beaks
together&mdash;a veritable kissing, accompanied with
loving gestures. They are also more sociable, and
even at nesting-time more peaceable, than other
birds. In the case of other grosbeaks, when the
male bird sits by the female in the nest, there
are various demonstrations of affection, but also
slight occasional disputes, especially about feeding-time.
Next in order come the small parrots,
which also appear almost inseparable. The male
bird feeds his companion with seeds from the
crop. This goes on quite regularly during the
hatching, and until the young are somewhat grown.
During all this time the hen-bird, which broods
alone, never leaves the nest but for a few minutes,
and the cock shews such affectionate care, that the
whole day he seems to do nothing but take food
and give it again. Yet even this loving union is
marred from time to time, even during the hatching-time,
with quarrels that even come to blows.
Again, the male bird of a pair of chaffinches only
occasionally sits on the eggs or young, but he
watches the nest very carefully, singing to his
mate the while, accompanies the hen in flight, and
helps her in feeding the young.</p>

<p>The marriage unions of parrots present great
differences. The long-tailed Australian parrots,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">{269}</a></span>
beautiful in plumage, but mentally inferior, are
not nearly so affectionate towards each other as
the little short-tailed species. M. Russ, a careful
observer, tells us that the male bird of the Australian
Nymph Cockatoo generally remains by night
with the female, and during the day sits much
more than she does. Such parental care is rare.
Many parrots, especially large species, are by no
means peaceable in their sexual relations, and
appear somewhat affectionate only at the time of
nidification. Large parrots are commonly very
excited at brooding-time, and ferocious towards
other animals, and even men. All parrots shew
affection by giving food out of the crop.</p>

<p>A quite peculiar wedlock is observable in some
of the finches and other birds. 'In my aviary,'
says M. Russ, 'I had a pair of saffron finches,
at whose behaviour I was for some time quite
astonished. The cock and the hen hunted and
persecuted each other savagely for days and weeks
together; it was not, as in the case of some
other birds, mere sport and teasing, but a bitter
strife; the end of which was that the male bird,
which appeared to have the worst of it, made
his escape altogether, and never returned. Yet
these two birds nestled, and actually reared
four young, though I could not perceive whether
their hatred was laid aside, or at least abated,
during the hatching.' Similar phenomena, though
not so pronounced, occur amongst finches, parrots,
birds of prey, &amp;c.</p>

<p>We have already said that the grosbeaks express
affection for one another. The male frequently
also performs a dance before the object of his regard;
he hops about in a droll courtesying manner,
with outspread tail and nodding head, warbling at
the same time a melodious ditty. The larger
grosbeaks give forth peculiar sounds accompanied
with a hopping movement. These love-dances are
frequently to be noticed in bird-life; among the
best known and most skilful in this respect are
those of the black-cock, the love-making of which
is exceedingly interesting to watch.</p>

<p>The strong pugnacity developed among birds at
time of hatching is remarkable. Even the little
gentle grosbeak will endeavour, by violent pecking,
to drive away males of the same or closely related
species from the neighbourhood of his loved one.
The larger finches are often roused by the same
zeal to a blind fury, which, in the case of the
chaffinch, is frequently taken advantage of by
the bird-catchers. The fights observed in nature
between birds have most generally for their cause
the emotions of love.</p>

<p>We come to another expression of affection in
bird-life&mdash;namely, song. It is to a great extent of a
purely emulative character, and not seldom is the
contention so strong and persistent, that one of the
two rivals, through over-exertion, falls lifeless to the
ground. One may observe such rivalry in spring,
in the woods and fields, between two neighbouring
male finches, nightingales, and various other birds.
And in the aviary it is to be observed not only
among the excellent singers, such as the gray
finches and red cardinals, but also in the comparatively
silent grosbeaks.</p>

<p>But the singing of birds has of course also another
aspect&mdash;it is the most potent means of wooing.
And this is true not only as regards the sweet
plaint of the nightingale, the melodious warbling
of the finch, but also of the hoarse croaking of
the crows, the ear-splitting screech of the jay, the
murmur of the pigeons, and the like&mdash;doubtless
the most bewitching tones they are able to produce.
'Hark! the lark at heaven's gate sings;' so says
Shakspeare. And for what does the lark ascend
and trill his cheerful lay in mid-air, but to sing in
a spirit of kindness to his mate nestling on the
ground within hearing of his notes; or as a versifier
has pictured this delicate attention:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The lark on high now mounts the sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">All hear his pipe a-ringing;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His mate on nest whom he loves best,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Sits listening to his singing.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It can hardly be doubted that the response
awakened in the heart of female birds in these
circumstances is quite as genuinely tender as the
notes addressed to them. The very birds of the
air might teach a lesson to man&mdash;to the wretches
who, in the bosom of civilisation, kick wives to
death, and leave their children to die under the
accumulated miseries of want and desolation!</p></div>

<h2><a name="THE_MONTH" id="THE_MONTH">THE MONTH:</a><br />
<br />
SCIENCE AND ARTS.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the meeting of the Iron and Steel Institute
last month, Mr C. W. Siemens, F.R.S., was elected
President: to the honour of the Institute, be it
recorded. In his inaugural address he discussed a
question on which he has bestowed much thought,
namely fuel. The coal-fields of the globe, so far
as at present known, comprise two hundred and
seventy thousand square miles, one hundred and
ninety-two thousand of which are in the United
States, eighteen thousand in Nova Scotia, and
eleven thousand nine hundred in Great Britain.
Mr Siemens is of opinion that at our present
rate of consumption, we have in this country
coal enough to last eleven hundred years;
and that if the consumption should tend to
increase, it will be kept in check by the economical
processes of heating that remain to be discovered.
And in many parts of the world there
are underground stores of gas that can be made
available as fuel, as exemplified by the seventy
furnaces at Pittsburgh, which do all their puddling
and reheating by means of the gas flowing through
eighteen miles of pipe from its source in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>As an example of the saving that can be effected
by mere mechanical contrivance, we take a new
ship of the Inman line trading between Liverpool
and New York, in which the old style of engine
has given place to the 'modern double cylinder
compound engines,' which leave a much larger
space for cargo than the old engines, and burn
about sixty-five tons of coal per day, instead of
one hundred and fifteen tons. The saving in the
article of fuel is thus seen to be very great, even
for a single ship.</p>

<p>Of course iron and steel were prominent topics
of discussion at the meeting, and the conclusion to
be drawn therefrom is, that in ship-building and
other mechanical operations steel will take the
place of iron. The torpedo vessel <i>Lightning</i>, which
steams nineteen knots an hour, is already an evidence
of what can be done by the combined lightness
and strength of steel; another is promised
by Admiral Sartorius, which will cleave the water
at the rate of twenty-four knots, and steel ships of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">{270}</a></span>
large size are building and to be built for the
government. In this way the peaceful arts become
diverted to warlike purposes, and heighten the cost
of war to a prodigious extent.</p>

<p>The future of steel, said Mr Bramwell, F.R.S., in
his lecture at the Royal Institution, is to supersede
iron for almost everything except the forge-work
of common blacksmiths; and further, that part of
the province of cast-iron, such as toothed-wheels
and castings of complex form, which now, thanks
to Riepe's improved construction of moulds, can be
produced from molten steel.</p>

<p>Mr Siemens' process for the manufacture of steel
leaves nothing to chance. The quality of steel is
always that which was foreseen and desired; and
the samples, when submitted to the severe tests
imposed by the Admiralty, are never found to fail.</p>

<p>But Professor Barff's discovery seems to shew
that iron will not be easily superseded. If iron
can be produced that will not under any circumstances
get rusty, iron will become more useful
than ever. The discovery is this: that if hot iron
is placed in a chamber of superheated steam, it
takes on a black coat which is magnetic oxide, and
this coat is so hard and impervious to atmospheric
influences that rust will not form upon it. The
hotter the steam in which the process is carried on,
the harder is the coat: after an exposure of seven
hours to twelve hundred degrees, it will resist a
file. Consequently the strength of the iron is
greatly increased, and it can never become weakened
by rust. The importance of this fact can
hardly be overrated in connection, for instance,
with iron plates for boilers and ships, in which
unlimited strength would be highly prized.</p>

<p>We are told that the protecting coat can be put
on at small cost, and that it will probably be made
use of for iron goods of every description. 'Copper
vessels will no longer possess any advantages for
cooking, and iron saucepans will no longer need
to be tinned. Lead pipes for the conveyance of
water will in all probability be entirely superseded;
and there can be no doubt that new uses
for incorrodible iron will every day suggest themselves.
Messrs Penn of Greenwich are about to
undertake a series of trials for the purpose of
testing the strength of the prepared articles, so that
they may become able to speak with authority
upon the fitness of the protected iron for bridge
girders and architectural purposes.'</p>

<p>How to make iron without producing slag is a
question which, if any one can answer satisfactorily,
his reward shall be great in fame and
fortune. In Yorkshire alone, the blast-furnaces
pour out more than four million tons of slag a year,
from which fact the enormous quantity produced
throughout the kingdom can be judged of. Sixteen
million tons of refuse! What can be done
with it? In some places, land has been bought
or hired to provide space for the ugly heaps, and
many attempts have been made to lessen the
accumulation by finding uses for the slag. It has
been made into blocks and bricks for paving;
into slabs, pipes, brackets, and friezes; into cement;
into sand for fertilising purposes; and while in
the molten condition, has been blown into a substance
resembling cotton-wool. But some of these
attempts have failed, and not one has sufficed to
diminish the heaps of slag. And now another
suggestion, based on the fact that slag is vitreous,
is put forth, namely to convert it into glass. A
mixture of sand, soda, and slag melted in a furnace
will come out as glass. The experiment would not
be expensive, for slag in any quantity may be had
for nothing.</p>

<p>If some of those ingenious individuals who write
so frequently to the Admiralty or to the Royal
Society announcing that they have discovered the
true place of the axis of the earth, or the true
explanation of the precession of the equinoxes, or
the cause of compass deviation, would only turn
their attention to the questions in the foregoing
paragraph, they might perhaps make practical
discoveries which would be capable of proof, and
potential of profit.</p>

<p>Last session a paper on the Best Method of
Propelling Steamships was read at the United
Service Institution. In the discussion that followed,
Admiral Selwyn said experiment had shewn that
whether you divide the water by a very narrow
fine bow, cleaving the fluid like an axe, or whether
you put that narrow fine bow flat on the water,
and drive it over the water, the resistance is for
all practical purposes the same: having fine lines
there is no more resistance in the one case than
in the other. Experiment has shewn also that
between the finest vessel of deep draught and a
vessel of similar tonnage, built in the form of a
segment of a sphere, there is no difference of resistance.
'But there is this remarkable difference in
another way, that whereas the sharp deep-keeled
vessel plunges constantly under water, and makes
bad weather of it, the segment of the sphere
always rides over the water with perfect ease.'</p>

<p>And at the meeting of Naval Architects, Mr
Reed explained that a circular ironclad will float
better and carry heavier weights than a ship of
the ordinary shape, and yet not be deficient in
speed.</p>

<p>At last a parliamentary committee has been
appointed to collect evidence on the condition of
the Thames and other rivers, on the best means of
regulating them, and of economising the rainfall
so that there shall be a sufficient supply of water
at all seasons. This is a great question: human
requirements confronting the forces of nature with
a view to harmonious co-operation. According to
a statement made at a meeting of the Institution of
Civil Engineers, the quantity of water that flows
daily over Teddington weir is 3,223,125 tons;
hence the Thames will count for something in the
inquiry. Besides which, we may remember that
the commerce carried by the royal river amounts
to nine million tons annually.</p>

<p>At a recent meeting of the Franklin Institute,
Philadelphia, there were exhibited an Odontograph
for laying out the teeth of gear-wheels; an exhaust
nozzle for quieting the noise of safety-valves and
escape-pipes; an aspirator for ventilating mill-stones,
and a horse-shoe intended to prevent slipping
on a smoothly paved road. Readers desirous of
further particulars must write to Philadelphia; but
if that 'quieting nozzle' can only be made available,
passengers at railway stations and on board
steamboats will be spared the deafening roar that
now annoys them, and will feel grateful accordingly.</p>

<p>The last published volume of <i>Transactions</i> of
the Royal Society of Victoria contains a paper
entitled, 'Is the Eucalyptus a Fever-destroying
Tree?' a question which, as our readers are aware,
is not less interesting here in Europe than in Australia.
Baron von Mueller, government botanist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">{271}</a></span>
at Melbourne, has described more than one hundred
and thirty species of Eucalyptus: some grow
into forests of great extent both on high and low
table-land, others form dense desert scrub, while
others are so distributed as to impart a park-like
appearance to the landscape. The leaves are evergreen,
and so arranged that the light and heat of
the sun fall equally on each side; and the roots
are dispersive and drain water largely from the
soil. Besides the general constituents of a ligneous
vegetation, the Eucalyptus contains a gum-resin,
a volatile acid, and a peculiar volatile oil. The
finest forests, <i>Eucalyptus amygdalina</i>, extend inland
about one hundred miles, beyond which the scrub
species prevail. When by vicissitude of season
the seaward species are poor in volatile oil, then
the scrub is rich, and <i>vice versâ</i>. The extent of
scrub and forest in the three colonies of New
South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia is so
great that the quantity of oil therein contained
is estimated at 96,877,440,000 gallons. On this
Mr Bosisto, the author of the paper above referred
to, remarks: 'Considering that the same condition
exists throughout the major part of Australia ... we
cannot arrive at any other conclusion
than that the whole atmosphere of Australia
is more or less affected by the perpetual exhalation
of those volatile bodies.' The aroma thereof
would be disagreeable, were it not that 'volatile
oils have the power of changing oxygen into
ozone while they are slowly oxidising.' It can
hardly be doubted that the influence on climate
must be important. 'Let,' says Mr Bosisto, 'a
small quantity of any of the eucalyptus oils, but
especially the oil of <i>Eucalyptus amygdalina</i>, be
distributed sparingly in a sick-chamber, or over
any unpleasant substance, or add a small quantity
to stagnant water, and the pleasure of breathing an
improved air will immediately be manifest. The
application of this to the climate of Australia has
great force, for it is acknowledged that we possess
about us, both in bush and town, a large amount
of active oxygen, made frequently doubly so by
our vigorous vegetation.'</p>

<p>The conclusion from the whole series of facts
is, that the Eucalyptus <i>is</i> a fever-destroying tree.
Baron von Mueller states that the <i>Eucalyptus
amygdalina</i> in favourable situations grows to a
height of four hundred feet, that it yields more oil
than any other species, and bears the climate of
Europe. The species of quickest growth is the
<i>Eucalyptus globulus</i>.</p>

<p>In a communication to the Royal Astronomical
Society, Mr W. M. Williams points out that obscure
heat, such as that radiated from sun-spots, is much
more largely absorbed by our atmosphere than the
heat from the luminous parts of the sun's surface.
Consequently the obscure heat exerts an influence
on terrestrial climate as well as the luminous heat:
the former in preventing or modifying the formation
of clouds in the upper regions, and in producing
thereby meteorological results which would
be an interesting study. An illustration of what
is meant by this is afforded by a well-known
phenomenon, namely the general clearness of the
sky during full moon, the clouds having been
dissipated by the obscure heat-rays <i>reflected from
the moon's surface</i>.</p>

<p>If observations of the difference of absorption
between the two kinds of heat could be made at
different heights, we should have, as Mr Williams
says, 'a new means of studying the constitution
of the interior of the sun and its relations to the
photosphere. Direct evidence of selective absorption
by our atmosphere may thus be obtained,
which would go far towards solving one of the
crucial solar problems&mdash;whether the darker regions
are hotter or cooler than the photosphere?'</p>

<p>St Bartholomew's Hospital Reports contain an
article by Dr Hollis in which an attempt is made
to clear the study of mental physics of some of its
obscurity, and to shew what are the functions of
the brain and the way in which they may be
studied. Examples are given of the effects of
disease: a letter-sorter in the Post-office had experienced
a failure of memory during two years,
could not continue his employment, and eventually
died. A large tumour was found in the substance
of the left temporal lobe of the brain, which probably
accounted for the loss of memory and inability
to retain a mental picture of the pigeon-holes into
which the letters were to be sorted. The organs
of the brain were there, but their proper action
was disturbed by the growth of disease, and the
man of necessity ceased to be a letter-sorter. In
concluding his article, Dr Hollis warns 'students
of this seductive branch of medical science not to
attempt to localise in the cortex too closely the
several faculties of the mind. It is preposterous,'
he remarks, 'to expect that similar cells are
reserved for similar functions in all human brains,
knowing what we do of the great diversity in man's
mental nature, his various occupations, proclivities,
and talents. Beyond the fact that there exists in
our brains a posterior or retentive system, and an
anterior or expressive system, our knowledge of
this organ will not at present permit us to go.'</p>

<p>The effect of ether and of chloroform as anæsthetics,
is attracting considerable attention. It is
alleged that with chloroform, vascular paralysis
frequently precedes respiratory paralysis; and an
amount of chloroform insufficient to cause paralysis
of respiration will often produce vascular
paralysis, accompanied by such a diminution
of blood-pressure as to render artificial respiration
useless, since interchange between the gases
of the air and blood does not take place. In this
case artificial respiration does not recall life, and
respiration ceases when artificial aid is removed.
Experiments made with nitrite of amyl demonstrate
its value as an antidote to the dangerous effects of
chloroform; for which reason an American physician
remarks: 'In the light of our present knowledge,
it seems to me that humanity and science
alike require that, when chloroform is used as an
anæsthetic, the nitrite of amyl should be at hand,
as one of the remedies whose efficiency is to be
tested in case of impending danger.'</p>

<p>Medical practitioners in Calcutta have had their
attention called to a species of parasite before undescribed,
which has been found in large numbers
in the intestines of persons who have died of
cholera. According to a description recently published
in the <i>Journal</i> of the Asiatic Society of
Bengal, it is the <i>Amphistoma hominis</i>. 'I have
never seen such parasites,' writes Dr Simpson,
'and apparently they are unknown to the natives.
They are of a red colour, size of a tadpole, adhering
to the mucous membrane, by a circular open
mouth which they have the power of dilating and
contracting.' It is to be hoped that these somewhat
mysterious tormentors will not make their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">{272}</a></span>
appearance in Europe. By way of precaution, we
would just hint, 'See that you drink pure water.'</p>

<p>Of petroleum furnaces of a small size suited
for high temperatures we find Quichenot's (lately
noticed in these columns) is not the first attempt
made, one having been introduced some years ago
by Griffin, an English manufacturer. The difficulty
with all petroleum furnaces is to keep them
lighted until the casing or crucible is sufficiently
hot to do this itself. The special liability which
petroleum furnaces have to blow out <i>at first</i>,
is to a great extent if not entirely overcome in
Griffin's by the use of a wick. We are told by
those who are practically conversant with the
subject, that there are many difficulties in the
use of petroleum as a fuel for furnace-work on a
small scale, which, however, may be in a measure
overcome by skilful management. But for small
furnace operations it is now generally admitted
that there is no fuel so well adapted as gas.
A gas furnace of an entirely novel construction
was introduced about a year ago by Mr Fletcher,
F.C.S., of Warrington, in which the gas is burnt
by an arrangement similar to Giffard's Injector,
and requiring no more air than an ordinary
small foot blower will supply with ease. The
whole arrangement is exceedingly simple; and a
refractory clay crucible can be fused in less than
half an hour by an apparatus which (blower
included) can easily be carried in one hand. Of
gas furnaces not requiring a blast, the pioneer was
Gore, who made the first draft furnace, burning
gas, which would fuse cast-iron; and the principle
made use of by Gore&mdash;that is, the subdivision of a
large flame by air-spaces&mdash;has been since made use
of successfully in many forms by different makers;
but the maximum temperatures obtained in Gore's
furnace have never yet been exceeded by any
maker without the use of a blast. The nearest
approach to a draft furnace giving really intense
heats is, so far as we can ascertain, the Injector
furnace of Mr Fletcher, which requires only about
one-fifth of the air consumed to be supplied by
blowing, the remaining part of the air being drawn
in from the surrounding atmosphere by the action
of the furnace itself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A large</span> party of merry people, old and young,
were sitting on the sands at Cromer one day,
when one of the party, the youngest and brightest,
began for fun to 'make faces' with her fingers, and
shewing the rest how to copy her. The way in
which she used her fingers and handkerchief produced
the most grotesque effects imaginable. Our
heroine, Mrs Reynolds, a young matron of the
party, followed suit, and soon succeeded; but, said
Minnie the original starter of the fun: 'Take off
your rings; they spoil the effect.' Accordingly two
valuable rings&mdash;emerald and pearl&mdash;were slipped
off and laid within an open parasol. Soon after
the party began to move, Mrs Reynolds took up her
parasol, thought no more of the rings, and passed
on with the rest home. Not till she reached the
house and, preparing for lunch, was about to wash
her hands, did it suddenly flash upon her what
she had done. Alas, alas! those precious rings
were lost on the sands, already crowded with excursionists
and bathers. Away flew Mrs Reynolds,
her hair streaming behind her (hung out to dry
after bathing), her heart panting, her head aching,
down to the shore again. There was the bathing
woman calmly pursuing her calling all unconscious
of the trouble; there too was Captain Wardell,
politely concerned; there the groups of cousins
warmly sympathetic; but alas! no trace of the
jewels lost. How should they ever be found in
such an expanse of sand?&mdash;no trace even left of
the spot where the friends had sat. Still, resolved
not to be baffled (the rings were not only precious
but full of associative value), a place was fixed
upon by Mrs Reynolds, and the hunt began. The
sand, loose and fine, was turned over and over and
sifted inch by inch, and the hapless owner was at
length compelled to abandon the search and return
home. Her weary feet had hardly turned in at
the threshold when a panting voice behind caused
her to turn. There stood a kindly cousin, scarlet
with excitement and running, almost unable to
speak, but holding up the emerald ring found by
Captain Wardell's little son Gordon, a child of five
years of age. As a last hope, his father had said
to him: 'Come, Gordon, feel for it too in the loose
sand;' and as if by magic, the child thrust in his
little fat hand and pulled out the ring!</p>

<p>Of course this shewed they were on the right
scent; and in three-quarters of an hour more the
pearl ring also turned up. They had hunted in
all for nearly two hours, in perfectly loose sand,
on a wide shore; and as a fisherman said, it was
indeed like 'hunting for a needle in a haystack.'
The excitement throughout the little town of
Cromer had been immense, owing to the crier
having been sent round; and all the evening the
story was being discussed by little groups of men
and women, no doubt growing in interest by the
repetition.</p>

<p>Another curious instance of losing and finding
is worth recording. A gentleman walking along
the shore of Hastings lost his ring. We think he was
stretching after a dog in the water, but at anyrate
the ring slipped off, and was not found again. A
year after&mdash;it is even said on the very anniversary&mdash;the
same gentleman was again strolling along
the shore when a fisherman ran after him, and
inquiring, 'Did you drop this, sir?' held up to
him his own ring, lost twelve months before.</p>

<p>One more incident. A gentleman bought an
umbrella, and taking it into his hand, put down
a sovereign in payment. Presently the bill, having
been made out, was presented; but when the shopman
put his hand forth to take up the money, it
could not be seen. The gentleman thought it
extraordinary&mdash;the shopman equally so. The
former was sure he had deposited the coin,
the shopman equally certain that it had not
reached his hands. What was to be done? It
ended in the gentleman again paying the amount.
Some little time after, the gentleman was again in
the shop, and being there, took occasion to ask if
the sovereign had ever been seen again. 'No,'
said the young man; 'we never found it.' Just
then the gentleman, opening his umbrella to shew
what he required altered (some trifle or other), gave
it a shake, when out rolled a sovereign; the very
one of course so long missing. The strangest part
of it is that the umbrella had been constantly
used since the day it was bought.</p>

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
